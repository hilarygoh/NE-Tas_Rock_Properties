# Abstract
The Enhanced Geothermal System potential of the Lower Paleozoic basement rocks in north east Tasmania was evaluated by laboratory measurement of petrophysical, geochemical and thermal properties and one dimensional modelling. Rock properties for Mathinna Group metasediments and a range of Devonian granite lithologies were recorded on 90 core samples from nine diamond drill holes.  
 
Density, porosity, magnetic susceptibility, sonic velocity and electrical resistivity were measured using standard equipment and laboratory techniques. New techniques were developed and refined to measure thermal conductivity, heat capacity and the K, U ,Th elemental abundances using a gamma ray spectrometer. 
 
Elemental abundances were used to calculate the heat generation of each lithology. Four granite bodies sample in this project had a high heat production, >7µW/m3. The majority of high values came from the the Royal George granite which also had the highest individual value, 22µW/m3. Mathinna metasediments had low heat generation values, <3µW/m3. Mathinna sandstones had the highest thermal conductivity values ~4.4W/mK and shales the lowest with  ~2.7W/mK. Granites had intermediate thermal conductivities ~3.5W/mK.  
 
Geothermal explorers should target low thermal conductivity basement rocks (shales) because they act as insulators for heat producing granites. Low thermal conductivity shales also had low sonic velocities. This correlation has the potential to be utilised in seismic surveys to target large volumes of basement rocks with low sonic velocities which are the low thermal conductivity shales. The ideal geology for geothermal exploration in north eastern Tasmania are low conductivity shales overlying high heat producing granites, similar in composition to the Royal George granite, to produce a high temperature resource.
